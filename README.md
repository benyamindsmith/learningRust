# learningRust

A repository of my adventures learning the Rust programming language. 

The code here will be organized similar to my long outdated [PythonMusings](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/PythonMusings) repository. I will also hope to share some interesting resources of my findings along the way.

I'm trying to learn Vim also, so this is a the developing experience is going to be totally different than my usual RStudio/VSCode workflow.
